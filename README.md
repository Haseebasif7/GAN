- `DCGAN.ipynb` â€“ Deep Convolutional GAN for image generation.
- `GTN.ipynb` â€“ Generative Teaching Networks.
- `pix2pix.ipynb` â€“ Paired image-to-image translation with pix2pix.
- `SNGAN.ipynb` â€“ Spectral Normalization GAN.
- `StyleGAN_comp.ipynb` â€“ StyleGAN component exploration.
- `Temporal_GAN.ipynb` â€“ Applying GANs to temporal (time-series) data.
- `UNET.ipynb` â€“ U-Net architecture used in GANs.
